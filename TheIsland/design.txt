SWEN502 The Island

class Island
- Stores a list of Creatures
- Stores a list of GeographicFeatures

// yeugh. pretty sure the creatures should be a class. 'cause... they all do the same mf things
way easier
right?
being able to move etc.
i reckon. cool! okay. 

Class Animal
	class Rabbit extends Animal
	class extends Animal

interface Creature
class Rabbit implements Creature
class Sparrow implements Creature
class Kiwi implements Creature - can eat from ground at any location
// class Fish implements Creature - only live in water
class Cat implements Creature
// class Chicken implements Creature
// class Crocodile implements Creature
// class Cheetah implements Creature
// class Rat implements Creature
// class Platypus implements Creature
// class Wolf implements Creature

Creatures should have:
- energy level, depletes with every movement, replenished by eating, if reaches 0, creature dies and is removed.
- hydration level, depletes with every movement, replenished by visiting water.
- x, y coordinates

 should be able to:
- move
- detect food
- detect water
- detect predators
- detect prey
- mate with creatures of the same type

interface GeographicFeature
class Water implements GeographicFeature
class Plant implements GeographicFeature
	class Brush extends Plant
	class PineTree extends Plant
	class Grass extends Plant
	class AppleTree extends Plants

GeographicFeatures:
- can coexist with a Creature at a point on the Island
- have coordinates x, y

Plants have:
- a size. grows with time and shrinks when fed on by a Creature. if size shrinks to 0, plant disappears
- seeds which disperse randomly (are carried by feeding creatures? nice) to cause another plant of the same type to grow elsewhere
